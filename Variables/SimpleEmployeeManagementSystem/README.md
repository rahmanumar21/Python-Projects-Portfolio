### **Core Python Concepts:**
- **Lists:** Store and update the list of employees dynamically.
- **Functions:** Modular design with `add_fruits_from_input()` and `main()`.
- **String Manipulation:** Format and clean user inputs using `.strip()` and `.title()`.
- **Loops:** Continuous user interaction with a `while` loop.
- **Conditionals:** Decision-making to exit or continue adding employees.
- **Unpacking:** Efficiently separate elements from the list using Python's unpacking syntax.
- **Input/Output:** Collect and display data dynamically through the console.
